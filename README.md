Pilviväylä Consortium
=====================

Pilviväylä Consortium as planned to be the organization responsible for Pilviväylä service. Consortium will be formed during spring/summer 2014. In the same process Open Product Management Model (design by VTT) is applied to Pilviväylä service. COSS – Centre for Open Source Software will act as an umbrella for the consortium building. It has not been decided that "Pilviväylä product" will remain under COSS in the future. 

The overall timetable towards pilot is below. The dates given in the image might change, but it should give you an overview of what happens and when. Items in the roadmap are discussed below the image. The dates are listed under the topics and those should be obeyed. Expect the written dates to be more accurate than the ones in image.
